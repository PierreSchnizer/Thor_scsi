"""Handle engineering tolerances

The task is split up in two different entites:

    1. create commands that describe a random distribution

    2. create commands that will apply a variation to a given
       property of the element.

The first a sequence of commands are used to describe the varations
(see :class:`EngineeringDistributionCommand`).

Using a :class:`ǹumpy.random.Generator` these commands are used to
create a sequence of commands that describe how each element property
should be changed precisely. These commands are then executed by
:func:`àpply_factors`.

This functionallity is intended to support engineering tolerance
studies. The user is expected to create commands describing how
the user wants to variy the different parameters. If the identical
variation can be used for different elements,
:func:`create_distribution_commands` will be handy.

The specific commands that describe what specific changes will be
applied to the different elements (and its properties) can then be
created by :func:`create_commands_for_randomised_state`.

the function :func:`apply_factors` can then be used to apply these
commands to all the different elements. This function has been split
from the functionality of creating the specific command so that the
user can inspect or store this specific set of commands.


The pseudo random number generator to be used is under users control.
It has to conform to the :class:`ǹumpy.random.Generator` API. Thus
the user can control the seed and similar aspects by the pseudo
random number generator's API.

If replay of random number generation is of interest, please note
that the sequence of engineering distribution commands supplied to
:func:`create_commands_for_randomised_state` is important. It will
make calls to the random number generator in the order as the
commands are applied. Please also note that changing the vector
size has an impact. Thus it is currently discussed if the element
properties, that are vectors should benignly ignore elements of
the scale or add vector that are beyond the size of the vector to
work on. This would allow e.g. to apply the same engineering values
to the multipoles if e.g. 4 or 10 multipole are used, as long as
the same vector length is used in the instances of
:class:`EngineeringDistributionCommand`.


Todo:

    * consider interface change: provide generators with a similar
      interface as :func:`create_commands` but returing a generator
      instead

    * consider changing commands info on element:

        * handle properties as separate properties implementing get
          and set

        * properties should have a reference to an "element info"

        * this element info should contain as much information as
          required so that a user could find out which element of
          the lattice was to be changed to a particular value.

          Compare this to just storing its index: if a component is
          split up the index is not reliable source of information.

        Exporters / importers should be able to handle that many
        properties could reference to the same eleemnt.

    * a good information that would allow tracing the individual
        element could be

        * element type name
        * element name
        * element index within its family
        * main beam dynamics parameters:

          * element length
          * for magnets: e.g. main multipole number
          * for quadrupoles: gradient strength
          * for cavities: frequency and voltage

        These inforamtion are not ment to be reporcesed by an
        function but rather help the experienced user to trace
        back which element should be changed.


    * consider if created :class:`EngineeringCommand` should
      reference the corresponding
      :class:`EngineeringDistributionCommand` so that user could
      process the list if required

    * implement utility functions simplfying common tasks
